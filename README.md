### Amsterdam-Airbnb-Locations-app

Wrangled Airbnb listings dataset in Amsterdam, close to a chosen tourist site (Vondel Park).                                                                          
I created a map and deployed it using streamlit
I filtered the data to show only listings below 200 EUROS.                                                                                                               
I also included distance in meters between the chosen tourist site and the Airbnb locations.                                                                                                       

Initial dataset provided by [CoRise](https://corise.com/)
